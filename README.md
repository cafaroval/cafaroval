# 👋 Hi, I'm Lala Jafarova

I'm a Cognitive Science graduate with hands-on research experience in **EEG analysis**, **brain stimulation**, and **experimental psychology**. My work spans topics like cognitive control, sleep chronotypes, and signal-space modeling of brain activity. I enjoy building reproducible pipelines that bridge neuroscience and computation.

This GitHub portfolio showcases selected academic and research projects I’ve worked on during my Master’s and lab rotations.
